# emanf9.github.io
This is just a test website (or blog?) by me.
If for some reason you wish to use my blog as a template for yours, feel free to clone the repository and use it yourself. Just clone it using either the Github Desktop application or Git Shell (both will install locally). You should now have a folder on your computer containing all of the files shown in this repository. You should now change the index.html file because you probably don't want your website to exactly mirror mine. Also, make sure to change the CNAME to your website name otherwise it will be hosted on emanf9.github.io (my website). In case you don't know how to clone, please go to the following link: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

If you wish to host your website using Github Pages you will need to upload the file you downloaded to an existing repository. To do that, you can use either the Github Desktop app or Git Shell. For the Desktop app, make a repository named [username].github.io on github.com and then open the newly made repository in the Desktop app and right click on it ande choose "Open in Explorer". Move the contents of your newly downloaded file into the repository folder you just opened. Now close Explorer and press sync. You files should now be available in the repository. To upload files using Git SHell, please refer to here: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-from-the-command-line/
