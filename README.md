# emanf9.github.io
This is just a test website (or blog?) by me.
If for some reason you wish to use my blog as a template for yours, feel free to clone the repository and use it yourself. Just clone it using either the Github Desktop application, Git Shell (both will install locally), or just fork the repository via the website. If you installed locally, you should have a folder on your computer containing all of the files shown in this repository. This can then be uploaded (via the Github Desktop application or Git Shell) into your own Github Pages repository and it should work just fine (although you should change the index.html file because you probably don't want your website to exactly mirror mine). Also, make sure to change the CNAME to your website name otherwise it will be hosted on emanf9.github.io (my website). If you forked the repository, it should already be good to go, other than you need to change the CNAME and index.html.
